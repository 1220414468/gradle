Note: The following section should be rather short and link to further readings elsewhere in the docs:

== Working with the software project

- Executing tasks
- Importing in IDE

== Working with components in isolation

- Treating a component as isolated build (note about the Gradlw wrapper)
- Importing a component in isolation in the IDE

== Publishing binary components

- You can publish a component and simply exchange it
- Mention build cache - i.e. performance should usually not be the only reason to publish to repo

== Using multiple repositories

- Moving to multi-repos
- Use publishing
- Require checkout of other repo
- (Should we mention source dependencies here?)

== Sharing repository and included build declarations

- Repositories in settings (for plugins and components)
- Settings plugins
