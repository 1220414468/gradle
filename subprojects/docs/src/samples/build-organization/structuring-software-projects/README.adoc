TODO still missing in this sample:

- Tests
- Aggregation component

This sample shows how to structure a software product that consists of multiple components as a set of connected Gradle builds.
As such, it shows how Gradle is sued to model a project's architecture and reflect that in the physical structure of the files that make up the software.
This example is described as part of the link:{userManualPath}/structuring_software_products.html[documentation on this topic].
